# IoT-Smart-Alarm
This is an IoT driven security alarm system prototype using an arduino board, a motion sensor, a ping sensor, RGB LED light, an arming button, and a keypad. The project uses python scripts with a raspberry pi to control the information and send a notification to the alarm owner's email with a report.
